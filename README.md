buzzfeed-blocker
================
You know what I hate? Meaningless content aggregators. Websites that pull in stupid links from around the web, contributing nothing to my life. Websites that publish "articles" with titles like "24 Reasons Mayonnaise is the Devil's Condiment."

If you couldn't figure out that I was talking about Buzzfeed, you live a much happier life than me.

Frankly, I don't find Buzzfeed funny at all. I'm sick of seeing its links shared all over Facebook. Then I remembered, "Max, you're a programmer! You can do this stuff yourself!" So I set out to write a little Chrome extension to block Buzzfeed. Here it is.

Features
--------
This extension currently blocks Buzzfeed shared links on:

* your news feed
* wall posts on profile pages
* group walls

It currently does not block people crafty enough to post a link to Buzzfeed as a normal "text" post. This wouldn't be that hard to add.

Not an official extension
-------------------------
I haven't actually released this as an official Chrome extension yet. If you want to use this, just download the directory and set it up in developer mode. Given that y'all are fellow programmers, it shouldn't be too hard to do.

Please help me out!
-------------------
I'm no Javascript expert, and I'd never written a Chrome extension before this. There are inefficiencies in this code that I'm aware of and am planning to fix. There are almost definitely inefficiencies in this code that I'm *not* aware of. Feel free to fork, pull request, email, or Tweet. Together, we can stop Buzzfeed in the most efficient way possible.
